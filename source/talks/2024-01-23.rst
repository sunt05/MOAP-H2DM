:Title: Disasters and Climate Change

:Abstract: Without doubt, we are changing the world's climate quickly and substantively. Yet any disaster including conflict is often linked to climate change. Many disasters are actually much more a result of other human decisions about where people live, or are forced to live, and the options they have, or do not have, for helping themselves to avoid calamity. In so many situations, disasters could be avoided, no matter what the climate is doing or what we are doing to the climate. In other instances, human-caused climate change is leading to disasters with the only disaster prevention option being for us to stop changing the climate. This talk explores the differences and nuances, demonstrating how much we could do to avoid disasters, including conflict.
