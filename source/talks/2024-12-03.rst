:Title: *Roundtable discussion on climate variability*

:Abstract:
    This event is a follow-up to Shipra's talk on 4th June 2024, where we discussed the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and raised interesting questions about the current and future climate variability.
    So in this event, we will discuss the current state of climate variability and the challenges in predicting it.
